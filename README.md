### How Correct Answers Work

- When creating a quiz, the creator selects which option is correct for each question.
- This is stored in the database as the `rightAnswer` field, which is the index of the correct option.
- When a user takes a quiz, their selected answer index is compared to the stored `rightAnswer` index.
- If they match, the answer is marked as correct and points are awarded.
- All answers and results are saved in the database for later review.
